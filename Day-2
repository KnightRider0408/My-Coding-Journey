Day-2: (Date:- 16/12/24)

Topic:- Introduction to Flow chart and Pseudo Code.

#What I learn:- 
Flowcharts: A visual representation of an algorithm, using different shapes like ovals (start/end), rectangles (process), diamonds (decisions), and arrows (flow direction).
Pseudocode: A textual representation of an algorithm using plain language, focusing on logic without specific syntax. It's used to plan and communicate algorithms before coding.
Differences and when to use flowcharts vs. pseudocode in algorithm design.

FLowchart and Pseudo code helps to understand the problem and get th step-by-step solution of the problems.
